## About The Project

Project Cortex was originally started in [August, 2019](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646/) but came to see an early end in [October, 2019](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646/index3.html#post8972698).
The Project was started again in [November, 2019](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646/index4.html#post8975706) but was cancelled in [January, 2020](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646/index5.html#post8986387), before being picked up again in [March, 2020](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646-post8996798/#post8996798) and finally cancelled in [November, 2020](http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/project-cortex-1164646-post9047781/#post9047781).

Needless to say, Project Cortex never maintained a clear trace of what the status of the project was, if it was discontinued, why it was restarted, over and over. Unfortunately, the blame is to be put on me (Cake). I overworked and got burnt out, after having made some incredible progress over the months.

Project Cortex has since been picked up on under a closed-community estabilishment where significant progress has been made. Project Cortex is aimed to become one of it's own private servers, and the client may or may not be distributed open-sourced in the future.

**The goal of this project is to revive an international Habbo Retro, built from scratch up.** There is no deadline or launch date, and there won't be any, until Project Cortex is no longer a project, but a community server.
